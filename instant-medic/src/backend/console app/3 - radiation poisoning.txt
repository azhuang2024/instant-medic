Name: Anatoly Dyatlov
DOB: 03/03/1931
Description:
I was just sitting on the toilet during a safety trial, but my vomiting, dizziness, and overall headache keeps me from any blame for what happened. My continued nausea and low blood pressure will be the least of my problems. Whatever you diagnose, it is not radiation poisoning.
